1. Phage conversion factors denoted with underlining in [1]_ are here denoted as optional '[]' with the exception of the exclusive factors (e.g. {15} and {15,34}).
2. Serovar Montevideo is listed twice in [1]_:  O:7 I 6,7,[14]:g,m,[p],s:[1,2,7] and O:54 I {6,7,[14]}{54}:g,m,s:â€“. The profile from the 'Alphabetical List' p. 137 will be used here - I 6,7,[14],[54]:g,m,[p],s:[1,2,7].
3. As in [1]_, although S. bongori is not a subspecies of S. enterica, symbol 'V' was retained in order to avoid formatting confusion.
