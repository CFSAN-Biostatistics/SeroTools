This package serves as a toolkit and repository for the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme 
for Salmonella serotyping, which defines nomenclature and antigenic factors for each 
recognized serovar. The scheme is made available in multiple formats, along with methods 
for querying, comparing, and predicting serovar names and antigenic formulae.

SeroTools was developed by the United States Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food 
Safety and Applied Nutrition.
